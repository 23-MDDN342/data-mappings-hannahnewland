## 2024 MDDN342 Assignment 3: Data Mappings


I decided for this project I wanted to take the apple imagery from my assignment 2 and bring it across. I took inspiration from Magritte's "The Son of Man" painting, and I wanted to recreate that kind of apple-covering-face look while still keeping it similar to assignment 2. The lips of the apple match the face tracking landmarks. 

Initially, the slider settings followed this:

Setting 1 - Number of Eyes: A male-presenting face will have 1 eye, a female presenting face will have 2 eyes.

Setting 2 - Is the Mouth Open?: relatively self explainatory!!

Setting 3 - Eye Size: The size of the eyes should correlate to how many ears are visible on the person. No visible ears is the smallest eyes, 1 visible ear is medium sized, and both ears visible is the largest size.

Setting 4 - Tilt Value: tilt value is determined by hair length. If the person has long hair, the apple is upright. If they have short hair, the apple is upside down. 

Setting 5 - Colour: The colour of the apple is determined by the colour of the person's hair.

Setting 6 - Nose?: The person will not have a nose if they have a happy expression. 

When I went to put the images in, it was really struggling with the settings I'd originally picked.
