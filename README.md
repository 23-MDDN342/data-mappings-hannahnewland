## 2024 MDDN342 Assignment 3: Data Mappings


I decided for this project I wanted to take the apple imagery from my assignment 2 and bring it across. I took inspiration from Magritte's "The Son of Man" painting, and I wanted to recreate that kind of apple-covering-face look while still keeping it similar to assignment 2. The lips of the apple match the face tracking landmarks. 

Initially, the slider settings were I think too vague, and it really struggled to pinpoint what I was wanting it to. When I went to put the images in, it was really struggling with the settings I'd originally picked. So I changed the settings, and retrained it. Now the settings look like this:

Setting 1 - Number of eyes: male presenting people have 1 eye, and female presenting have 2.
Setting 2 - Is the mouth open?: relatively self explainatory!
Setting 3 - Eye Size: eye size corrolates to eye colour - the lighter/bluer the eyes, the smaller the eyes.
Setting 4 - Colour: the colour of the apple is linked to the colour of the hair. 
Setting 5 - Nose?: nose is linked to expression. If they appear happy, they do not have a nose. 

I settled on pictures of fleetwood mac because they were established in the same decade as when "The Son of Man" was painted, and they offered some variety in facial features. 

I removed the mouse from my assignment 1 code because I felt if you were using it as a zoom background it could be fun to move into the space the mouse was so the mask on your face could look like snake food.
